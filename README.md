Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster-Predict survival on titanic- Kaggle competition

## Planning:
* Exploring Survival on the Titanic: Data exploration + visualizations and a random forest benchmark model. Great  example of how to present your data science work using R Markdown.
* Random Forest Benchmark (R): Basic random forest model for you to build on and submit. 
* A Journey Through Titanic: Nicely scripted data exploration and benchmark model in Python.
* Decision Tree Visualization and Submission: Benchmark model in R with a nice example of a decision tree visualization.
